# UI to Code Generator - Development Log

## Project Requirements

1. Create a tool that uses AWS Bedrock with Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet to generate web code from UI design images
2. Implement an HTML interface for image upload and progress display
3. Save generated code directly to local files
4. Leverage LLM tool use capabilities
5. Implement an agentic approach for code generation process
6. Use Python for implementation

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Flask Web Application**
   - Handles image uploads
   - Provides progress tracking API
   - Serves generated files

2. **AWS Bedrock Integration**
   - Uses boto3 client to connect to Bedrock in us-east-1 region
   - Sends images to Claude 3.7 Sonnet model
   - Processes model responses

3. **File Management**
   - Saves uploaded images to `uploads/` directory
   - Saves generated code to `generated/` directory
   - Provides access to generated files

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Real-time updates on processing status
   - Visual progress bar in web interface

### Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main Python application
- `templates/index.html` - Web interface
- `uploads/` - Directory for uploaded images
- `generated/` - Directory for generated code
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### Setup Process

1. Created directory structure
2. Implemented Flask application with Bedrock integration
3. Created web interface with Bootstrap 5
4. Added progress tracking functionality
5. Implemented file saving capabilities
6. Set up virtual environment for dependencies

### Testing

- Installed required dependencies in virtual environment
- Verified AWS credentials configuration
- Tested application startup

## Usage Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Ensure AWS credentials are configured with Bedrock access
3. Run application: `python app.py`
4. Open browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
5. Upload UI design image
6. Click "Generate Code" button
7. Monitor progress in real-time
8. View generated code files when complete

## Technical Notes

- The application uses threading to prevent blocking during processing
- Image is encoded to base64 before sending to Bedrock
- Generated code is extracted from model response using regex patterns
- Progress updates are provided through a polling mechanism
- Error handling is implemented throughout the application
